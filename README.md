# gadsbyprocessor
A word processor for constrained writers that highlights all occurrences of the letter 'E'. Inspired by the book "Gadsby: 50,000 Word Novel Without the Letter 'E'". 

MAJOR BUG - if the user deletes keys until an 'e' and begins typing, the text will continue to be highlighted.
  I haven't had the time to look into it, please try and fix this before anything else.
  
DESIRED FEATURES: (please add features you wish to see)
-Adding more constraints other than highlighting only 'e's
-Adding different fonts and text colors
-Giving counts of characters that violate restrictions
-Find and replace

etc. for standard word processor features
